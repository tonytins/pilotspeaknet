# Change Log

## 1.0.100

PilotSpeak.NET now targets .NET 6.0!

- Removed a lot of boilerplate code that is no longer necessary
- Statements from the ``Main()`` method have been moved to the top-level
- No longer on PeachPie SDK preview!
- Simplified project names

=======

## 0.1.100

- Added Docker support
- Moved CSS and JS files to wwwroot directory
- Use .NET SDK [versioning conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/versions/)
- Replaced ``wordbank.php`` with ``wordbank.json``
- Renamed top wordbank variable to getjson because that variable already exists further down

### Note

Technically speaking there was no ``0.1.x`` up until ``1.0.x``. These notes were retroactively added to the changelog for the sake of completeness.
